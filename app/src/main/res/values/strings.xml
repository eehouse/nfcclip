  <string name="about_expl">NFCCopyPaste has only one feature: it
  transmits the contents of your clipboard to another device via NFC.
  ("NFC" is Near-Field Communications, the super-short-distance radio
  used for Android Pay and other tap-to-share
  technologies.)

  \n\n

  Android 10 disabled the tap-to-share feature, based on NFC, that
  lots of my favorite apps used to exchange data with themselves. My
  wife and I were used to sharing ColorNote shopping lists this way,
  for example. I couldn\'t fix ColorNote, but I could take advantage
  of its use of Copy-and-Paste by writing this app. Now we share lists
  by copying them on one device, touching the two, and pasting them on
  the other.

  \n\n

  I hope you\'ll forgive the rough look of this app. I\'ve been
  programming Android for 10 years but am not a UI designer. I\'m
  sharing this because I hope it will be useful. If it is, and people
  want to contribute icons or other visual improvements, I\'ll include
  them. Reach me at xwords@eehouse.org. Thanks!
