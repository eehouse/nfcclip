  <string name="about_expl_1">NFCCopyPaste does only one thing: it
  transmits the contents of your device\'s clipboard to another device
  via NFC. ("NFC" is Near-Field Communications, the tap-to-share radio
  technology used for features like Google Pay.)</string>

  <string name="about_expl_2">Android 10 disabled the \"Android Beam\"
  feature, based on NFC, that lots of my favorite apps used to
  exchange data with themselves. My wife and I were used to sharing
  ColorNote shopping lists this way, for example. I couldn\'t fix
  ColorNote, but I could take advantage of its use of Copy-and-Paste
  by writing this app. Now we share lists by copying them on one
  device, touching the two, and pasting them on the other.</string>

  <string name="about_expl_3">I hope you\'ll forgive the rough look of this app. I\'ve been
  programming Android for 10 years but am not a UI designer. I\'m
  sharing this because I hope it will be useful. If it is, and people
  want to contribute icons or other visual improvements, I\'ll include
  them. Reach me at xwords@eehouse.org. Thanks!</string>
