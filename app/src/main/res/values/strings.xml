  <string name="about_expl">NFCCopyPaste has only one feature: it
  transmits the contents of your clipboard to another device via NFC.
  ("NFC" is Near-Field Communications, the super-short-distance radio
  used for Android Pay and other tap-to-share
  technologies.)

  \n\n

  I wrote it after Android 10 disabled the feature, based on NFC, that
  lots of my favorite apps used to share data with each other. My wife
  and I were used to sharing ColorNote shopping lists this way, for
  example. I couldn\'t fix ColorNote, but I could take advantage of its
  use of Copy-and-Paste. Now we share lists by copying them on one
  device, touching the two, and pasting them on the other.

  \n\n

  I hope you\'ll forgive the rough look of this app. I\'ve been
  programming Android for 10 years but am not a UI designer. I\'m
  sharing this because I hope it will be useful. If it is, and people
  want to contribute icons or other visual improvements I\'ll include
  them! Thanks.
